AB  - Studies have suggested the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in
      protecting intestinal barrier function from injuries induced by multiple
      reagents. Vitamin D deficiency was reported to be associated with poor prognosis 
      in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This study is designed to
      investigate the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on ethanol-induced intestinal barrier
      dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms utilizing Caco-2 cell monolayers and a 
      mouse model with acute ethanol injury. In Caco-2 monolayers, ethanol
      significantly increased monolayer permeability, disrupted TJ distribution,
      increased phosphorylation level of MLC, and induced generation of ROS compared
      with controls. However, pre-treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 greatly ameliorated the
      ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction, TJ disruption, phosphorylation level of MLC,
      and generation of ROS compared with ethanol-exposed monolayers. Mice fed with
      vitamin d-sufficient diet had a higher plasma level of 25(OH)D3 and were more
      resistant to ethanol-induced acute intestinal barrier injury compared with the
      vitamin d-deficient group. These results suggest that the suppression of
      generation of ROS and increased phosphorylation level of MLC might be one of the 
      mechanisms underlying the protective effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on ethanol-induced
      intestinal barrier injury and provide evidence for the application of vitamin D
      as therapeutic factors against ethanol-induced gut leakiness.
